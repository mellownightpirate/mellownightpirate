A podcast to chronicle other developersâ€™ journey into coding. Itâ€™s no secret that the primary purpose of this podcast is to network with other developers to better understand their motivations, work ethic, and journey in software development. Iâ€™m hoping this will interest a lot of other people who can identify with this journey, especially at this time.
